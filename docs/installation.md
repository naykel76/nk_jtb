## Install via npm

The recommended way to install the framework is through npm. This allows you to
easily manage dependencies and stay up to date with the latest releases.

```bash +code
npm install nk_jtb
```


## Using CDN

For quick prototyping or testing, you can include the framework directly via CDN
without any build process.

## Basic Setup

After installation, import the framework in your main JavaScript or CSS file to
start using it in your project.


## Configuration

Create a configuration file at the root of your project to customize the
framework settings according to your needs.
